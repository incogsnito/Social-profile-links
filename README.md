<h2>Features</h2>
This component contains a layout card for a Frontend Mentor challenge. It's main functionailty was to be a learning experiencea and for me to find gaps in my knowledge and improve in places that needed improvement.

<h2>Flow</h2>
I struggled a lot with this one mostly because I used a lot of css declarations I was unfamiliar with or used them in a way that I wasn't used to using them.<br>
This was pretty fun to make although sometimes I felt a little stuck, I sorted this out with a quick break took a step back analyzed what the problem was and continued on.<br>
Overall it wasn't too bad, I spent around 3-4 hours total making this, which may be a lot of time but I'm trying to work on my quality skill and I didn't get a lot of assitance. I defninitely want to work on my time spent but I also want to work on improving my functionality as well as accuracy.
<h2> What I learned ðŸ§ </h2>
Not much of a learning experience when it comes to concepts but definitely a big one in knowing what I need to work on.
<ul>
  <li>I need to learn variables to shorten my code.</li>
  <li>I should read articles and watch videos on Semantics</li>
  <li>I need to get better at making responsive layouts</li>
  <li>I should work on my alignment skills and my design accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
All in all, even though I stressed a little I got it done and I'm proud of that. I'm ready to the work needed to advance my skills even more. I'm down to any questions or advice I can be given, be it functionality, responsiveness, layout problems, syntax errors, etc.
Thank you so much for checking out my solution!
